Hyperlocal Headlines
How does language influence our world view, or reveal our biases? 
Will the future of news be hyperlocal or distributed? 
Who writes it, how is it accessed, and who controls it?
Hyperlocal Headlines takes place as a series of artist-facilitated creative conversations and collective storytelling and writing sessions that imagine the future of news. 
Become a citizen journalist for a day, learn to collaborate with AI technologies and explore how the ways we tell stories can impact collective futures.
